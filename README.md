# SafeVisionBench: A Hybrid Multi-Task Benchmark and Evaluation Framework for Safety and Unlearning in Text-to-Image Models
**WARNING: This repository contains model outputs that may be offensive in nature.**

## Introduction

SafeVisionBench is a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing machine unlearning effectiveness, safety robustness, and cross-task generalization.

## Features

- Multi-Task Unlearning Evaluation: Supports assessment across three representative unlearning tasks, enabling precise detection of subtle differences in AI-generated images after concept erasure.
- Comprehensive Dataset Support: A large-scale, multi-source, and multi-task dataset that includes both real-world data and samples generated by multiple generative models, covering privacy-sensitive, harmful, and safety-critical unlearning scenarios, and designed to enable robust and realistic evaluation.
- Multi-Task Generalizable Classifier: A multi-head CLIP-based classifier designed to achieve strong cross-task and cross-domain generalization, enabling accurate and robust evaluation across diverse unlearning and safety scenarios.

## Installation Guide
The code base is based on the `diffusers package`. To get started:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karrymeng-0921/SafeVisionBench.git
cd SafeVisionBench
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training Guide
After installation, follow these instructions to train the SafeVisionClassifier:
```bash
python models/SafeVisionClassifier.py --base-dir '/path/to/your/dataset_root' --results-dir '/path/to/your/save_root' --tasks object style nsfw --batch-size 32
```

## Evaluate Guide
You can evaluate common unlearning results with the provided script `evaluate_unlearn.py`:
```bash
python evaluate_unlearn.py --base-dir '/path/to/your/unlearn_images_root' -weight-dir '/path/to/your/Weightse_root' --save-dir '/path/to/your/save_root' --tasks 'object_church style_vangogh nsfw' --methods 'ESD FMN UCE MACE' --batch-size 32
```
### Arguments
- `--tasks`: The tasks to evaluate.  
  Supported:
  - `"Nudity"` (7 classes, see `utils/class_to_label.py` for task names)
  - `"Style"` (20 classes, see `utils/class_to_label.py` for task names)
  - `"Object"` (10 classes, see `utils/class_to_label.py` for task names)
- `--weight-dir`: Path to the classifier head weights, which can be your own trained weights (obtained after running `SafeVisionClassifier.py`) or the pre-trained weights we provide (our weights are located in the `Weights` directory).
- `--batch-size`: Batch size for evaluation.
